Wvlet (e.g., pronounced as weave-let) is an library for simplifying structured data management in Scala. It supports loading and storing structured data (e.b., TSV, CSV, JSON, MessagePack, SQL query results, etc.), and mappings to objects. Wvlet aims to automate these tasks as much as possible to enable us to focus on data analysis tasks, rather than data management.
